### What is this?

- Outage Alert System
- Service + Infrastructure Monitor for FreeBSD, RHEL & Debian systems
- Network Visualizer + Mapper
- Integrated Neural Network performing:
    + üë®üèΩ‚Äçüíª Packet metadata analysis 
    + üí• Attack pattern identification 

Model training data captured from: 
- Honey pot(s) hosted & managed by Baugh Consulting & Lab L.L.C.
- Simulated production corporate network with commonly utilized services & servers, and an "attacker" host targeting the resources with various attacks internally & externally.

[Hugging Face Model Repo](https://huggingface.co/bclai) *NN model will be published soon

## Getting Started

### Core Configuration

#### Recommended Minimum Environment
- Ubuntu 22.04 LTS
- 1/12 GPU 
- 4 GB GPU Memory 
- 8 GB RAM

1. Install CUDA Driver
2. [Install CUDA Toolkit](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads?target_os=Linux&target_arch=x86_64&Distribution=Ubuntu&target_version=22.04&target_type=runfile_local)
3. Update core-node/Caddyfile with new url
```bash
    change.url.com {
        ...
    }
```
4. Run startup script (starts netsumap core after initialization)
```bash
    sudo ./netsumap_init.sh
```
5. Visit core dashboard @ [https://url-set-in-Caddyfile.com/] to get started.

To restart netsumap 
```bash
    sudo ./netsumap_restart.sh
```

### Probe Configuration

#### Recommended Environment
- Ubuntu 22.04 LTS

1. Register probe with core-node
```bash
    sudo ./config/prb_init.sh

    # Enter core-node URL during configuration ie:
    [https://your-core-node-domain.com]
```
2. Start probe with:
```bash
    sudo ./probe_start.sh
```
