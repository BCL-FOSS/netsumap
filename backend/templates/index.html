                  Quart app using a neural network (NN) trained to classify IP packets as benign, outlier or malicious. Packet data is ingested via pcap files converted to CSV, JSON and live capture from a specified interface (*currently in development). The prediction results are used to automate security breach responses within REST API enabled network infrastructure commonly utilized by SMBs.

                  The NN was initially trained on data captured with the Cisco Mercury network metadata analysis tool. Traffic was generated in a simulated environment with a vulnerable VMs hosting several applications, and a Kali Linux VM simulating various attacks. As further research is conducted, the simulation environment will become more complex to match the ever changing landscape of cybersecurity threats and improve the quality of the data used for training.
